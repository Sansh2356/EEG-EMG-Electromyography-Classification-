# EEG-EMG-Electromyography-Classification-
In this repository you will find 3 coressponding jupyter notebooks can be accessed directly and run on your kernel.

## 3 implementations namely:-
1)MAIN -: In this implementation you will find 3 models implementation along with evaluation metrics of each:-
### KNN
### Descision Trees
### Random Forest

## 2)DASK 
   <p>  In this implementation you will find the use of DASK lib of python instead of PANDAS utilizing the power of parallel<br>
          computation thus helping to load large dataset without hampering the RAM accesibility.</p>
          
## 3)CUSTOM-METHOD 
 <p> I was facing problem due to large dataset hence i tried to make custom loading script along with my fellow batchmate <span><b>Karan</b></span>
                   in which we have trained using chunk sizes set up with chunk size of 10e6.
                   also saved the result of each training in a joblib file.</p>
